deprecations:
  - |
    If a volume_name is present in the skip_block_devices property,
    the function validate_confiuguration will now fail unless
    all logical disks in the target_raid_config have a volume_name
    specified.
fixes:
  - |
    The skip_block_devices property now supports RAIDs, including scenarios
    with multiple arrays on the same physical disk. This included 6 smaller
    bugs that have all been addressed.
